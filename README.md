# Graphical Models

This is a self-contained version of "Learning Whatâ€™s in a Name with Graphical Models". The HTML & JavaScript that is generated (via `yarn build`) works without needing a live backend. A pre-built version is available in `/public`.

The full version (connected to a live backend, and thus can provide predictions of arbitrary string inputs) lives on [graphical-models.netlify.app](https://graphical-models.netlify.app).

## Setup

First, to install the required packages, run the following commands in bash:

```
yarn install
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

Then, to start a local development server, just run:

```
yarn dev
```

That's it! The site should be up and running on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

To build, just run:

```
yarn build
```

And the compiled site will be in `/public`.

## Project Structure

```
| src
    | pages
    | layouts
    | components
    | images
| public
```

In the `src` folder:

- `pages` contains files to be turned into individual pages during the Gatsby build process. This project only has a single index page, so there is only one file, `index.js` in here.

- `article` is where the article's main content (text, visualizations, etc.) lives

- `layouts` stores a global layout component that is wrapped around every page. This is useful for providing global contexts, like a theme context. Implemented using `gatsby-plugin-layout` [(view docs)](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-layout/).

- `images` contains all raw image files that will be transformed into dynamic, efficient image formats through `gatsby-plugin-image` [(view docs)](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image/).

- `components` is where to store the reusable React components and page-specific components.

The `public` folder contains the built website (after running `yarn build`).
